- Level 1: configure application using [outbox pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transactional-outbox.html)
with Debezium.

### Links 

- [intro.md](./docs/intro.md). Setting up `Zookeeper`, `Kafka`, `MySQL` and `KafkaConnect` to database  via command line 
in multiple terminals. 
- [java-simple-app.md](./docs/java-simple-app.md). *WORK IN PROGRESS*: Java application with `docker compose` setup for 
debezium. It uses listener to read debezium events to update it's internal state.
- [java-app-outbox.md](./docs/java-app-outbox.md). *WORK IN PROGRESS*: Java application with `docker compose` setup for 
debezium that exposes two apps: one produces events using outbox pattern and another reads those events. Uses persistent 
storage for database and kafka
