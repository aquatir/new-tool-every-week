# new-tool-every-week

Jack of all trades, master of none but oftentimes better than a master of one.

Idea of this repo is to learn a bit about a lot of tools every week. I'll be mostly using Java but might add an extra
language. 

All projects will have a dedicated readme.md inside + an overview of what I managed to achieve in a week. Those will mostly 
include official tutorials ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Navigate to any project to see for yourself.

# Facts

The older things I've competed. This list grows from newest to oldest.

- week 3 — [Cassandra](/week3-apache-cassandra). Docker-compose setup + Java client example with [Datastax](https://github.com/datastax/java-driver).
- week 2 — [Terraform](/week2-terraform). Basic setup + AWS with modules.
- week 2 — [pgq](/week2-pgq). My failed attempt to even install PGQ :D
- week 1 — [Debezium](/week1-debezium). Docker compose setup + Java app to read topics
