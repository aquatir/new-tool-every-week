# new-tool-every-week

Jack of all trades, master of none but oftentimes better than a master of one.

Idea of this repo is to learn a bit about a lot of tools every week. I'll be mostly using Java but might add an extra
language. 

All projects will have a dedicated readme.md inside + an overview of what I managed to achieve in a week. Those will mostly 
include official tutorials ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Navigate to any project to see for yourself.

# In Progress (week 4) — PostgreSQL leader + 2 replicas setup + Patroni

project: pg-cluster [Navigate to page](/week4-pg-cluster)

# Facts

The older things I've competed. This list grows from newest to oldest.

- week 3 — [Cassandra](/week3-apache-cassandra). Docker-compose setup + Java client example with [Datastax](https://github.com/datastax/java-driver).
- week 2 — [Terraform](/week2-terraform). Basic setup + AWS with modules.
- week 2 — [pgq](/week2-pgq). My failed attempt to even install PGQ :D
- week 1 — [Debezium](/week1-debezium). Docker compose setup + Java app to read topics

# Plans

The next few project I'd like to tackle.

## Plan 2023

- week 5 (02.01.2023 — 08.01.2023): Postgres LISTEN / NOTIFY mechanism
- week 6 (09.01.2023 — 15.01.2023): R2DBC https://r2dbc.io
- week 7 (16.01.2023 — 22.01.2023): Cassandra 3-nodes setup + testing failover.
- week 8 (23.01.2023 — 29.01.2023): k6 https://k6.io load testing tool by Grafana labs 

In no particular order:

- k9s Kubernetes client https://k9scli.io
- Quarkus https://quarkus.io
- Rust language https://www.rust-lang.org
- Map Reduce Lab from [MIT 6.824](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/).
- Trie (aka Prefix Trees?) data structure & algorithms using it.
- C++ — basic build tools, testing, setup
- ???
